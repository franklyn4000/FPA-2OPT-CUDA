# FPA-2OPT-CUDA
### Efficient trajectory planning algorithm using the Flower Pollination Algorithm for Global Optimization [^1]. augmented with some 2-OPT iterations.



## Overview

Vincent Roberge & Mohammed Tarbouchi proposed this algorithm in their paper 
**Hybrid deterministic non-deterministic data-parallel algorithm for real-time 
unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory planning in CUDA** [^2]. This projects tries to re-recreate 
their results with a special focus on finding ways to optimize the CUDA implementation and
exploring possibilities of deploying it on current mobile hardware. We also include scripts
for parsing .xyz heightmaps and visualizing the generated trajectories as well as benchmarking
the algorithm itself with varying configuration parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Computer with a CUDA capable GPU
- CUDA libraries
- python3

Compilation has only been tested on linux-based systems.

## Usage

Parse the provided heightmaps (or alter to use custom heightmaps.)
The algorithm will fail without having done this once.

`python3 heightmapper/heightMapParser.py`

Edit config files (and their copies!) as needed. Parameters are explained in the next section.

`config/config.json`
`config/init.json`
`config/drone.json`

Run the algorithm:

`algorithm [-cuda] [-omp] [-t] [-o output_file_name]`

- [-omp]: run the GPU version of the algorithm
- [-cuda]: run the GPU version of the algorithm
- [-t]: optional flag that makes the CUDA algorithm write its results to files. Slightly, aster without.
- [-o]: an optional string to be appended to all output files to facilitate separating different runs.

Note: If both -omp and -cuda are set, the algorithms will run sequentially.

Use the visualizer to show a browser-based 3D representation of the generated paths

`python3 heightmapper/heightMapVisualizer.py`
